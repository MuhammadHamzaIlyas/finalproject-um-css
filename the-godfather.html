        <p class="description">Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on Mario Puzo's novel, The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that chronicles the rise and struggles of the Corleone crime family in post-World War II America. The story begins with Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the aging patriarch of the powerful family, who seeks to pass on his empire to his reluctant youngest son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino).<br> As Michael transitions from an outsider to the family's ruthless leader, the film explores themes of loyalty, power, and the moral costs of ambition. Renowned for its powerful performances, haunting score, and iconic scenes, The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in cinematic history.</p>

        <p class="description">A rare sequel that equals, or even surpasses, its predecessor, The Godfather Part II serves as both a continuation and a prequel to the original story. The film contrasts two parallel narratives: Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) expansion and consolidation of the Corleone family's power in the 1950s, and the story of young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) as he builds his criminal empire after immigrating to America in the early 20th century.<br>Through these interwoven stories, the film examines the complexities of family, betrayal, and the corrupting influence of power. De Niro’s performance earned him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, and the film itself won six Oscars, including Best Picture.</p>

        <p class="description">The final chapter in the trilogy, The Godfather Part III, explores the twilight years of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) as he seeks to legitimize the family's business and atone for his past sins. Now older and burdened by guilt, Michael faces challenges from within and outside the family as he struggles to protect his legacy.<br>The film also introduces Vincent Mancini (Andy García), Michael's fiery and ambitious nephew, who represents the next generation of the Corleone family. Though less acclaimed than its predecessors, Part III is a poignant conclusion to the saga, reflecting themes of redemption and the cyclical nature of violence. A re-edited version, Mario Puzo’s The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone (2020), further refines the story's ending.</p>
